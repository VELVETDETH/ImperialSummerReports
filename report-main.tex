\begin{abstract}
This is the 7th week of my summer research, and this report will contain mainly what I've done in the past 2 weeks, including MaxJ SpMV inplementation, Ruby multipumping implementation, and some bug fix in Ruby compiler.

\subsection{Multi-pumped BCSR design}

Referring to the BCSR format, we will calculate multiple multiplication in one single tick, which is a brillliant feature to be multi-pumped. But due to the constraints of MaxCompiler, we need to have multiple kernel blocks now, as we could only assign one universal clock rate to each kernel. We could divide this multi-pumped BCSR design into 3 parts:

\begin{description}
\item[Gather] For each pipe, we need to gather the input vector and value vector. Input vector means the values in the vector parameter, read from ROM. 
\item[Multiply] We send those input and value vectors to this multiply part, and this part runs at 2x clock rate, which is the computation core of multi-pumping design.
\item[Sum] Will take result from multi-pumping multipliers and use summation tree to sum them up. It will also take a \texttt{start} stream to denote whether the current calculated block is the start of each group.
\end{description}
